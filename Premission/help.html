          href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> plugin installed for PC in order to use the power of blockchain
        technology.
        After you have downloaded metamask,you must create an account. It will be your access to ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN
        NETWORK. Now you have your own ETHEREUM ADDRESS in the blockhain. PowerChain uses Ropsten Test Network. So, you
        have to switch from Mainnet to Ropsten in the top right
        window in Metamask.</br>Then RELOAD the page.Congratulations! Now your data can be easily stored into the
        blockchain.

      <p>
        When the data is pushed to the blockchain you have to confirm your transacion in Metamask. By clicking the "Подтвердить" button in the plugin. If you do not confirm the transaction the data will no be stored into the blockchain.
        You will see the following alert "user denied transaction".
