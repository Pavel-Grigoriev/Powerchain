# Powerchain created by Pavel Grigoriev 2018/2019
The main goal of the project is to help pupils aqquire motivation and skills while stydying and to make the teachers' work way easier (especially in the first 5 grades where teachers are tend to spend a lot of time and energy making kids listen to them and creating extra motivation programms for childern).
New project is a website that uses blockchain technology.
We use Ethereum blockchain paltform, our smart-contracts are deployed into the Ropsten test network.
For the working issues we have created our own ERC20 token (cryptocurrency).
The project is monitoring pupils' social activity and is holding a social activity portfolio. It is easy to access the data. All our clients' data is safely stored in blockchain network, that is why nobody (and even the adminidtrator) is able to change or delete the information.
